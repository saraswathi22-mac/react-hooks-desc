      <h1>Use Effect Hook</h1>
      <li>
        useEffect() allows functional components to have access to the lifecycle
        hooks.
      </li>
      <li>It performs side effects in functional component.</li>
      <li>
        The function runs when the component is first rendered, and on every
        subsequent re-render/update.
      </li>
      <li>
        useEffect Hook lets you run additional code after React has already
        updated the DOM.
      </li>
      <li>
        The useEffect Hook takes 2 arguments The first argument is a callback
        function that by default runs after every render. The second argument is
        an optional Dependency array that tells the Hook to only callback if
        there is a change in a target state. The Hook compares the previous and
        current state value of each dependency. If the two values donâ€™t match,
        the Hook uses the first argument callback. Dependency arrays override
        the default callback behavior and ensure the Hook ignores everything
        else in the component scope.
      </li>

      <h3>Variation of UseEffect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          useEffect without dependencies: it runs with first render and also run
          on any thing changes.
        </li>
        <li>useEffect with empty array: it runs only on first render</li>
        <li>
          useEffect with variables: it runs on first render and runs with that
          variable change.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Think of the useEffect Hook as a partial replacement for React lifecycle
        events. The useEffect Hook can replicate the behavior of
        componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount methods.
        Ie. you can respond to changes in any component that contains the
        useEffect Hook.
